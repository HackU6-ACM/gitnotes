## Purpose

This project is a Chrome browser extension that allows a user to add comments to a github project without cluttering the code with inline comments.

In order to use the plug-in a user must create an attributes file in the root of the repository for their project.   The attributes file should be named "gitnotes.json" and is a hidden file.  The file is a text file in UTF8 format.  Entries in the attributes file should be entered one at a time as follows:

#ENTRY#  
FILENAME</br>
CODE</br>
DOCUMENTATION</br>
MEDIA</br>

Where 
    FILENAME is the name of the currently browsed code file.
    CODE is a string matching the code to be documented.
    DOCUMENTATION is a string that will be displayed in a tooltip.
    MEDIA is a html rerference (local or external) to media (optional).

If no MEDIA html reference is to be provided, it is necessary to include a /# symbol in place of the html reference.
